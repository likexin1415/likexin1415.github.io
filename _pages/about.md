I received the B.E. from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chendu, China, in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree from the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, China, in 2022. From November 2019 to November 2020, I was a visiting student at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. From August 2022 to August 2025, I worked as the Research Engineer with the Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China. Since September 2025, I am with the Hangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University (XDU), Hangzhou, China. My research interests are mainly on communications, signal processing, and information theory, with the emphasis on satellite and massive MIMO communications.
